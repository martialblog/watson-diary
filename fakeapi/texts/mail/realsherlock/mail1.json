			I just got a request for a new case, we were asked to accomplish.
 			The 10-year old Ashley lost her cat and can't find it anywhere.
 			I know, you might think, this is below our standards, but we got to find this cat, this girl is too adorable!
			Let's meet at 3 for further investigation!
 			Yours,
			Sherlock.
 			P.S: Don't forget to bring crisps!"
